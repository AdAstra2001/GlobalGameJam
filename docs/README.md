## **Intro Screen**

As the nation of Theni commemorates its centennial, we honor the tragic event that reshaped our society. Twenty years ago, a massive chemical explosion killed millions and caused 99% of us to lose the ability to perceive emotions. As a mandated Mask Therapist, you will assign our residents the proper emotion masks so they can thrive in our wondrous society. Immediately dial 666-131-1911 to report unmasked citizens. If you see something, say something.

## Incorrect Ending(s)

David goes to buy his daughter a birthday gift – a cute white mouse. While talking to the black market seller, he is approached and arrested on a report for suspicion of wearing the wrong mask.

Alyssa avoids leaving her house and quits exploring. Her nightmares about the attack are less frequent. During an employee review, her boss notes an increase in productivity, causing her to be interrogated and taken into custody.

All traces of Sebastien have disappeared. Notably, reports of wild animal attacks seem to occur more often. One day, you receive a letter. Inside, there is a small paper saying: “A poor selection on your part. I will do what I must to avoid being reported.”

## Correct Ending(s)

David hits it big in the casino, and moves to the Upper Region with his daughter. He is now in the security division and is known for taking care of stray mice he finds.

After being fired, Alyssa decides to work for The Fortune Teller. Remaining haunted by the beast, they become notorious for advocacy on more vigilant safety patrols.

Sebastien is running in the next election, promising a better life for those in the Lower Region. One day, you receive a letter. Inside, there is a small paper saying: “You made the right choice. I will survive the proper way.”
